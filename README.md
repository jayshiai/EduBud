## ðŸš€ Getting Started

First, clone this repo and download it locally.

Next, you'll need to set up environment variables in your repo's `.env.local` file. Copy the `.env.example` file to `.env.local`.
To start with the basic examples, you'll just need to add your OpenAI API key.

Next, install the required packages using your preferred package manager (e.g. `yarn`).

Now you're ready to run the development server:

```bash
yarn dev
```

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser to see the result! Ask the bot something and you'll see a streamed response:

![A streaming conversation between the user and the AI](/public/images/chat-conversation.png)

You can start editing the page by modifying `app/page.tsx`. The page auto-updates as you edit the file.

Backend logic lives in `app/api/chat/route.ts`. From here, you can change the prompt and model, or add other modules and logic.
