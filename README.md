## ðŸš€ Getting Started

First, clone this repo and download it locally.

Next, you'll need to set up environment variables in your repo's `.env.local` file. Copy the `.env.example` file to `.env.local`.
To start with the basic examples, you'll just need to add your OpenAI API key.

The retrieval capabilities the agent use Supabase as a vector store. However, you can swap in
[another supported vector store](https://js.langchain.com/docs/modules/data_connection/vectorstores/integrations/) if preferred by changing
the code under `app/api/retrieval/ingest/route.ts`, `app/api/chat/retrieval/route.ts`, and `app/api/chat/retrieval_agents/route.ts`.

For Supabase, follow [these instructions](https://js.langchain.com/docs/modules/data_connection/vectorstores/integrations/supabase) to set up your
database, then get your database URL and private key and paste them into `.env.local`.

To try out the agent capabilites to interact with real time internet, you'll need to give the agent access to the internet by populating the `SERPAPI_API_KEY` in `.env.local`.
Head over to [the SERP API website](https://serpapi.com/) and get an API key if you don't already have one.

Next, install the required packages using your preferred package manager (e.g. `yarn`).

Now you're ready to run the development server:

```bash
yarn dev
```

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser to see the result! Ask the bot something and you'll see a streamed response:

You can start editing the page by modifying `app/page.tsx`. The page auto-updates as you edit the file.

Backend logic lives in `app/api/chat/route.ts`. From here, you can change the prompt and model, or add other modules and logic.

## â–² Deploy on Vercel

When ready, you can deploy your app on the [Vercel Platform](https://vercel.com/new?utm_medium=default-template&filter=next.js&utm_source=create-next-app&utm_campaign=create-next-app-readme).

Check out the [Next.js deployment documentation](https://nextjs.org/docs/deployment) for more details.
